📚  Learn Anything by Talking to AI Tutors

This is a small SaaS project that lets you learn by chatting with AI-powered tutors.
Pick a subject, choose a voice + style, set a session duration, and start learning with a friendly AI companion built just for you.

No complicated dashboards. No 900 features.
Just you + an AI tutor that actually explains things.
